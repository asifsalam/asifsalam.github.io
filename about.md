I am an analyst, currently living and working in Stockholm, Sweden, with my wife and two baby boys (16 and 20).  While some of my work involves advanced analytics and visualization, frankly, a lot of it is putting in place the basics, like improving data quality, data models, decent pipelines, standardization, automation and so on.  And to figure out how we can best use the data and analysis.  And budget discussions, of course.

I love (Darjeeling) tea, <strike>ice cream and brownies</strike>, crime fiction and science fact.

Found a couple of papers I was involved in, just before I left university.  They sort of date me, but it's nice to see them online after all this time!
