I am an analyst, currently living and working in Stockholm, Sweden, with my wife and two baby boys (16 and 20).  I love (Darjeeling) tea, ice cream, crime fiction and science fact. 


Found a couple of papers I was involved in, just before I left university.  They sort of date me, but it's strange to see them online after all this time!

<p><li>[Modulation Transfer Functions at Ka Band][2]</ul></li></p>
