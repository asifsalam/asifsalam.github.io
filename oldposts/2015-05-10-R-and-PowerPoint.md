title: How to Create Amazing PowerPoint Slides using R - Part 1 (3)
---

Let's face it, PowerPoint isn't going anywhere. Even if you use R (or Python) for data analysis, PowerPoint is how you distribute and communicate results, and learning how to create those decks as part of your R workflow can pay off.  Beyond efficiency, and repeatability, programmatic access enables you to do things that just aren't possible with point and click.  In this tutorial, we'll learn how to automate PowerPoint using R.

In this talk, [S Anand uses Python and **pywin32**][1] to create some jaw dropping effects in Powerpoint, scraping data from IMDB and creating a PowerPoint slide using the data.  [**RDCOMClient**][2] by Duncan Temple Lang allows you to do the same thing using R. It provides the ability to "access and control applications such as Excel, Word, Power Point, Web browsers etc."

We will recreate some elements of [S Anand's talk][1], and a few other things, with a focus on interaction and animation. We'll learn the basics of accessing methods and properties of PowerPoint VBA objects, scrape data on Clint Eastwood's movies from [IMDB][13], and use it to create a slide.  In the end, we should have a cool, fun PowerPoint slide with Clint Eastwood's filmography.  

<div class="warning"><p style="margin: 0 0 0 10px">
    <img class="centre_image" src="/images/caution_finland_road_sign_189.svg" alt="Caution" style="width:50px; margin:2px 0 0 5px; align:left;" >
    <b><i>I love animation, so there is a lot of it</i></b></p>
</div>

(Clearly PowerPoint has a powerful animation engine, and the [object model][6] allows you to programmatically manipulate almost everything. The [Microsoft documentation][5], however, seems to be organized as a challenge, at least for beginners.)

Let's get started.  
##Setup
I'm using:

* Windows 7 (64bit)  
* Office 2013 (64bit)  
* R version 3.1.3  
* RStudio verison 0.98

We'll need a few packages.

1. [RDOCMClient][2] by Duncan Temple Lang. COM client that allows us to manipulate PowerPoint through R.  
2. [XML][3] by Duncal Temp Lang. Parse XML files.  
3. [rvest][4] by Hadley Wickham. Web scraping simplified.

Start RStudio and Load the packages:

```r  
install.packages(c("RDCOMClient","XML","rvest"))  
library("RDCOMClient")   
library("XML")   
library("rvest")   
```

##RDCOMClient Basics
Some RDCOM basics we'll need to know: 

* To start a new instance of an application:  `COMCreate("xxx.Application")`
* Executing methods takes the form: `comObj$methodName(arg1,arg2,arg3,...)`
* Setting properties takes the form: `myObj[["Property"]] = TRUE`

With these basic capabilities, we can access and manipulate all the objects exposed in the PowerPoint API.

Let's create a new PowerPoint presentation from R  

```r
# Start up PowerPoint 
pp <- COMCreate("Powerpoint.Application")

# Make the application visible
pp[["Visible"]] = 1

# Add a new presentation
presentation <- pp[["Presentations"]]$Add()

# The presentation is empty.  Add a slide to it.
slide1 <- presentation[["Slides"]]$Add(1,ms$ppLayoutBlank)
     
```

The critical part is, of course, knowing what methods and properties are available.  This is where the [PowerPoint 2013 Developer Reference][5] is handy, but not terribly user-friendly.  (You can also get this information from the Object Browser in the VBA editor.)

To understand how to go from VBA to R, let's recreate one of the basic examples in the documentation, [Applying Animations to Shapes in Office 2010][7], which works with Office 2013 as well.

The VBA code:

```vb.net
Sub TestPickupAnimation()
    With ActivePresentation.Slides(1)
        Dim shp1, shp2, shp3 As Shape
        ' Create the initial shape and apply the animations.
        Set shp1 = .Shapes.AddShape(msoShape12pointStar, 20, 20, 100, 100)
       
        .TimeLine.MainSequence.AddEffect shp1, msoAnimEffectFadedSwivel, , msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious
        .TimeLine.MainSequence.AddEffect shp1, msoAnimEffectPathBounceRight, , msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious
        .TimeLine.MainSequence.AddEffect shp1, msoAnimEffectSpin, , msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious
       
        ' Now create a second shape, and apply the same animation to it:
        shp1.PickupAnimation
       
        Set shp2 = .Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeHexagon, 100, 20, 100, 100)
        shp2.ApplyAnimation
       
        ' And one more:
        Set shp3 = .Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeCloud, 180, 20, 100, 100)
        shp3.ApplyAnimation
       
    End With
End Sub

```

As you can see, Microsoft has defined a set of constants for each element of the presentation, such as shape, animation, trigger, etc.  I remember I had to search for a while to find a consolidated list of all the enumerated constants.  I created [a file][12] and just read them into one variable, `ms`. (Download it to your working directory if you want to execute the code.)

In the ```Ã€ddEffect``` method above, you'll notice an "empty" argument.  That tripped me up for a while, since it doesn't work with R.
The [AddEffect method][8] shows the arguments the method expect ```(expression.AddEffect(Shape, effectId, Level, trigger, Index))```.  Using an explicitly named argument (trigger) works.

Let's add the shapes and animation from the Microsoft example to the presentation we created earlier:

```r
source("mso.txt")
shp1 <- slide1[["Shapes"]]$AddShape(ms$msoShape12pointStar,20,20,100,100)
slide1[["TimeLine"]][["MainSequence"]]$AddEffect(shp1,ms$msoAnimEffectFadedSwivel,
                                                        trigger=ms$msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious)
slide1[["TimeLine"]][["MainSequence"]]$AddEffect(shp1,ms$msoAnimEffectPathBounceRight,
                                                        trigger=ms$msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious)
slide1[["TimeLine"]][["MainSequence"]]$AddEffect(shp1,ms$msoAnimEffectSpin,
                                                        trigger=ms$msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious)

shp1$PickupAnimation()
shp2 <- slide1[["Shapes"]]$AddShape(ms$msoShapeHexagon,100,20,100,100)
shp2$ApplyAnimation()

shp3 <- slide1[["Shapes"]]$AddShape(ms$msoShapeCloud,180,20,100,200)
shp3$ApplyAnimation()

```

This should create a presentation with the three shapes.  If you go into animation mode, the shapes should appear, with the animations triggered.

The [`shape` object comes with a long list of properties and methods][9].  Let's see how to use some of them. We'll add text, and change colors.

Each `shape` has an associated [`TextFrame property`][10], which returns an object containing all the text related elements of the shape.

```r
# Add text to the shapes.  While this works, R files a complaint
shp1[["TextFrame"]][["TextRange"]][["Text"]] <- "Shp1"

# This way seems to function better
shp1_tr <- shp1[["TextFrame"]][["TextRange"]]
shp1_tr[["Text"]] <- "ONE"
```

Let's set some shape attributes.  
The `Fill` property is used for the colors, and the `Line` property for the border.

```r
shp1_color <- shp1[["Fill"]]
shp1_color[["ForeColor"]][["RGB"]] <- (0+170*256+170*256^2)
# That's how the RGB value is calculated: r +  g*256 + b*256*256 

# Remove the line
shp1_line <- shp1[["Line"]]
shp1_line[["Visible"]] <- 0

```

Now, do it for the other shapes as well.  We'll create a function to handle the color encoding:

```
# Create function for the rgb calculation 
pp_rgb <- function(r,g,b) {
    return(r + g*256 + b*256^2)
}

shp2_tr <- shp2[["TextFrame"]][["TextRange"]]
shp2_tr[["Text"]] <- "TWO"
shp2_color <- shp2[["Fill"]]
shp2_color[["ForeColor"]][["RGB"]] <- pp_rgb(170,170,0)
shp2_line <- shp2[["Line"]]
shp2_line[["Visible"]] <- 0

shp3_tr <- shp3[["TextFrame"]][["TextRange"]]
shp3_tr[["Text"]] <- "THREE"
shp3_color <- shp3[["Fill"]]
shp3_color[["ForeColor"]][["RGB"]] <- pp_rgb(170,0,170)
shp3_line <- shp3[["Line"]]
shp3_line[["Visible"]] <- 0

# Finally, save the file in the working directory
presentation$SaveAs(paste0(getwd(),"/PowerPoint_R_Part_1.pptx"))

```
The code and the PowerPoint file created are available from [Github](https://github.com/asifsalam/PowerPoint_from_R).

Coming up:  
Part 2 - We'll scrape some data using [`XML`][3] and [`rvest`][4] and create a dataset of Clint Eastwood's movies.  
Part 3 - Then some fun! We'll use the data to play around with more advanced animation and interaction in PowerPoint.
