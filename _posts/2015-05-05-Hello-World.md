title: Writing your first blog post!
---

For many of us, there's just no getting away from PowerPoint.  So if you use R (or Python) for data analysis, and PowerPoint for presenting/distributing the results, it's worthwhile learning how to script this last step into your R workflow, making it repeatable as well.  In this talk, S Anand uses Python and [**pywin32**][1] to do some pretty nifty things with Powerpoint, from precisely placing images, to some eye-popping animation.  I stumbled upon [**RDCOMClient**][2] by Duncan Temple Lang, a package that allows you to do the same thing using R.


The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
